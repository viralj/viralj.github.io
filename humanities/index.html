<b  style="font-size:20px;">300:</b><br>
    <li>Spartan culture – the movie shows Spartans discarding unfit offspring which is true as 

well as boys leaving home at the age of 7 to train. The movie also depicts Spartans as 

the good guys, which wasn’t always the case. They were great warriors and their culture 

was based around war.</li>

<li>Spartan Women – the movie portrayed Greek women as important and powerful which 

is accurate. Queen Gorgo played an important role when it came to politics.</li>

<li>Leonidas - the movie portrayed his childhood in an inaccurate sense. He did not have to 

kill a wolf on his journey. He probably wasn’t as beastly as Gerard Butler, either.</li>

<li>Battle of Thermopylae – movie portrays Sparta as the only Greek force fighting the 

Persians which is not true. Initially, Athenians requested the help of Spartans. The 

Spartans did not just take the Persians on alone.</li>

<li>The End- The end of the movie was cool, but inaccurate in regards to the role of Dilios. 

Also very confusing in respect to the timeline of the second movie made 7 years later by 

a different director.</li></ul><hr>



<ul style="font-size:16px;">
<b style="font-size:18px;">300 Rise of an Empire:</b><br>

    <li>Sparta and Athens – The movie shows Athens and Sparta teaming up to take on Sparta, 

which is accurate. Many other city-states were also involved, but not at the forefront 

like Sparta and Athens.</li>

<li>Artemisia - The movie portrays her as cunning and powerful, which is true. The movie 

shows her childhood in a dark light, which was not accurate.</li>

<li>Themistocles – The movie portrays him as intelligent and a great naval commander, 

which is true. He also would become a powerful man in Athens.<li>

<li>Xerxes – The movie depicts transforming into a superhuman God-king, which did not 

happen.</li>

<li>The End - The end shows Artemisia dying at the battle of Salamis, which is not true. She 

goes on to live happily ever after.</li></ul>

<ul style="font-size:16px;">
<li>Things that make the Tru Blood representation of dionysus accurate</li>
<li>Followers of Dionysus show now inhibitions</li>
<li>Their form of worship often involves a euphoria and open sexuality</li>
<li>Females are more drawn to the cult of Dionysus because of a feeling of equality</li>
<li>He is represented as a horned god (bull/ goat)</li>
<li>The followers are technically in a state of substance induced madness</li>
<li>Sacrifices of blood are mad in order to summon Dionysus</li></ul>

<li>About a boy that needs to clear his name to Zeus and prove he didn’t steal his lightning bolt or all of the Gods will go to war</li>
<li>Good use of many different characters from classical Greek mythology</li>
<li>Characters include a Minotaur, Persephone, Medusa, the Hydra, the lotus-eaters, and many of the various gods</li>
<li>Main character Percy makes trip into underworld and fits many of the characteristics of the hero motifs</li>
<li>Does a good job of portraying the different characters similar to how we learned about them in class</li>
<li>Does a good job of modernizing the myths and putting a little twist on each one</li>
<li>Does bad job of intertwining the different myths into one big story</li>
<li>Confusing and sometimes hard to tell which myth they are trying to portray</li>
<li>Overall decent movie with good classical Greek mythology represented within it</li>

        <p>
            <ul style="font-size:18px;">
                <li>O Brother, Where Art Thou is a comedy portraying the epic poem "The Odyssey"</li>
                <li>It portrays a good example of the myth with the different adventures the men must endure</li>
                <li>Some parts of the movie are a stretch to fit "The Odyssey"</li>
                <li>One good example of "The Odyssey" is when the men in the movie encounter the sirens, and their beautiful music draws the men in</li>
                <li>This movie is really interesting if you know it is referring to the classic Greek myth "The Odyssey" </li>

of the Greek Empire. The main outline of the story is a war against a tyrannical warlord
